This dataset enables us to define the Machine Learning problem as a multi-class classification task, having 3 classes with 3 subclasses each, which inform the severity of the incident. Other approaches to obtain different datasets were tested: combining aviation incident data with data on all flights from a country proved unreliable, as there were no common features/identifiers in the datasets tested."
